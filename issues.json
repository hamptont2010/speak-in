These programs may be small, but they matter. They serve communities, support teachers, and give students access to a broader, more meaningful education.\n\nI\u2019m asking you to push for a better approach: fund and protect low-enrollment programs that still serve the public good. These cuts are too fast, too broad, and risk narrowing what education means in our state. Please reconsider. Thank you for your time."

I urge you to ensure any toll implementation includes exemptions or discounts for local drivers, safeguards against double taxation, and full transparency on where tolling would occur and how the revenue will be allocated.
